# Happy Ball
Open Source Unity Game where player can solve short puzzles as moving ball.
This is a challenge project to see if I can create a useable game within my URI winter break of 2020-2021.
The premise of the game is that the user solves simple puzzles using a moving ball called the "Happy Ball".
